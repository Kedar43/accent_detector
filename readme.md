## Notes
- The SpeechBrain model is loaded once and cached to improve performance on repeated runs.
- Temporary video and audio files are deleted automatically after processing.
- Accuracy depends on the quality of audio and the SpeechBrain modelâ€™s training data.
- Make sure video URLs are publicly accessible without authentication.
